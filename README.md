Product Demand ML Predictions


Product Demand Prediction with Machine Learning

Overview
This project is aimed at predicting product demand using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can forecast future demand for various products, allowing for better inventory management and supply chain optimization.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset: Your product demand dataset (CSV, Excel, or any other compatible format)
Getting Started
Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.

Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Place your product demand dataset in the project directory or update the file path within the Jupyter Notebook.

Open the Jupyter Notebook using jupyter notebook in the terminal.

Execute the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and make predictions.

Project Structure
product_demand_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions to:

Load and preprocess the product demand data.
Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.
Train and evaluate machine learning models for demand prediction.
Make predictions for future demand.
Customize the code to fit your specific dataset and requirements.

Run the notebook and review the results.

Results
The Jupyter Notebook will provide insights into the predictive performance of different machine learning models. You can assess the accuracy of demand predictions, identify important features, and visualize the results
